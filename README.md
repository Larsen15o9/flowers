Flowser is a convenient development tool for [Flow blockchain](https://www.onflow.org/), which starts and indexes flow emulator or testnet blockchains.

Flowser app is also available in hosted version (BETA) available at [app.flowser.dev](https://app.flowser.dev). You should only be use online version for demonstration purposes, as it currently supports only a single project at the time (not useful for parallel usage by many users).

For a quick walk-through of Flowser app, see our [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMs5awvGnlY&t=417s).

```

If you encounter any issues during app build or container start, check out our [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#-troubleshooting).

### 4. Open in browser

After flowser had successfully started, you can open the app in your favourite browser at [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060) ü•≥.

Good job, you can now start flowsing around the flow blockchain üèÑ.

## ‚ú® Features

### Flow emulator
Configure and run managed [flow emulator](https://github.com/onflow/flow-emulator) projects or start your own emulator instance on localhost.
